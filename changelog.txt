HB5Tool changelog
=================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(next version) - (n/a)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Various internal changes to player and team data structures, to allow better
  support for modifying data from multiple sources.
  (i.e. player/team exports and league files. Internal data found in
  HARDBALL.BIN/HB5CDROM.BIN is still not supported.)

- Added "Default PICS.BIN Path" to program settings.
  (Not used yet, much like the other program settings.)

- [Stadium INFO*.BIN Editor] Add visual representation of custom color sets.

  including the players on the roster.

- [DEFAULTS.BIN] More values identified and displayed in the editor.
